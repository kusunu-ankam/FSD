    	A friend means so much to us. And we enjoy being with our friends. True friends are hard to come by. True friends love each other through thick and thin. <b>They share with and care for each other at all times.</b>
    	
    	The bond between true friends is so strong that it lasts through life. Having a true friend is a real gift.
    	<br/>
    	 It is valuable like a precious jewel. And the friendship between true friends is always treasured and cherished.
