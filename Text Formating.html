               This class of <tt>deities</tt> has <hr>been </hr> seen as upholding the movables and immovable Dharma. <b>Adityas </b>are beneficent gods who act as protectors of all beings, who 10<sup>2</sup> are provident and guard the world of spirits and <i>protect</i> the world. In the form of<bdo> Mitra-Varuna<bdo>, the Adityas are true to the eternal Law and act as the exactors of debt.

              <del>in </del>the calendar and the twelve aspects of Sun. Since they are twelve in number, they are referred as DvadashAdityas.

These are also called the 12 purushas, pertaining to the 12 lunar months of the year. Here the months refer to the <font color="red"> months. In astronomy the lunar months</font> with a solar sankranti are said to have an Aditya or purusha. The month without a sankranti is said to be neuter and is said to be an extra month or the intercalary
